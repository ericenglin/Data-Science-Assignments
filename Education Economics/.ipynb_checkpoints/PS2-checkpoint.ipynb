I went to certain schools that resulted in certifications and authorization to perform specific roles as an officer. By holding those certifications my unit was allowed to assign more soldiers (high sc hool educated) to work underneath me in key positions. By getting those extra soldiers that freed up work hours from other people who had been covering those responsibilities. There was a compound effect from my arrival to work efficiency and positions available. Having another manager also meant that my boss (college educated) could focus more on their specific tasks instead of using their work week to supervise the other people in the unit. \n",
    "- **Gabriella Pierre**: As a soon to be worker in an educational non-profit committed to advancing equity for low-income, minoritized students, the spillovers I create on workers with less than a college degree are increased access to opportunities regardless of their educational background as I advocate for their inclusion in the work that we do. For college-educated workers, I am causing those individuals who may work with me, to be more productive and perform better, increasing overall team success.\n",
    "- **Eric Englin**: Before coming to grad school, I worked with homeless service providers to help get people into housing. One big part of my job was communicating to legislators that we were spending money effectively, so I think that a potential spillover would be if I did a good job in communicating that we needed more money to end homelessness, this could pave the way for more funding to all positions of people working in the same area.
