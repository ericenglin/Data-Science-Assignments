    "### Problem 3: Multiple Comparisons Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in class, a sequential randomized design is prone to the issue of multiple comparisons.  This problem steps you through making this determining this and correcting it 2 different ways.  Imagine the following AB test with a binary outcome and 2 treatment groups: after a burn-in period of 1200 subjects (600 in each arm), the appropriate $z$-test for proportions is performed to compare the two groups after every 200 subjects until up to 3000 total subjects are enrolled (so at $n=1200,1400,...,3000$ with exactly half in each group).  If either treatment is deemed statistically significantly better than the other (at a two-sided $\\alpha=0.05$ level), than the study is stopped. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the null hypothesis is true (there is no actual effect of treatment) and the rate of success is truly 20% in both groups (you can think of the response variable as the click-through rate and the treatment groups represent two different website layouts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1** Determine the overall 2-sided Type I error under these conditions when each test is performed at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level.  Perform 2,000 simulation replicates.  Report this Type I error rate in the separate quiz.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2** Determine a single adjusted $\\alpha$ such that the overall Type I error will be 0.05.  Report this adjusted $\\alpha$ rate in the separate quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3** An alternative approach is to not perform each test at the same adjusted $\\alpha$ but instead vary the $\\alpha$ of each test as the study progresses.  One common approach to doing this is to increase the $\\alpha$ by a specific amount each time a test is run.  So for example, the first test could be run at $\\alpha_1=0.001$, the second at $\\alpha_2=0.002$, the third at $\\alpha_3=0.003$, $\\dots$, the tenth $\\alpha_{10}=0.010$.  Provide an advantage to each of the two choices for adjusting $\\alpha$: the one described here and the single adjusted value from **3.3**. These can be short 1-2 sentence explanations for each.\n"
